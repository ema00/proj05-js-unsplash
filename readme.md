Rooftop Onboarding 2019
=======================

This README gives the description of some of the projects of the Rooftop Onboarding 2019.


Project 05: Javascript, advanced
--------------------------------

Encapsulate the functionality to make requests to a particular REST API using javascript.
Making requests to the unsplashed API, for searching images and random images based on a text string.
Made with an SPA using react to display the search results.


Project 06: Databases and ORMs
------------------------------

Expose a REST API that acesses a database through an ORM.
The ORM is accessed using the Active Record apttern.


Project 07: OOP and Patterns
----------------------------

Rewrite the starter code to implement the same functionality by using OOP.
The starter code is from the Gilded Rose kata. But, the objective is different from the one of the kata.

- v1: is the solution to the Gilded Rose kata, using OOP.
- v2: similar to v1, but objects calculate the state for any date.
